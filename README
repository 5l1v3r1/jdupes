Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
jdupes is a program for identifying and taking actions upon duplicate
files. This fork known as 'jdupes' is heavily modified from and improved
over the original. See CHANGES for details.


Why use jdupes instead of the original fdupes or other forks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest reason is also the most important one: raw speed. In testing on
various data sets, jdupes is *over 7 times faster* than fdupes-1.51 on
average.

It's also quite stable. All releases of jdupes are compared against a
known working reference version of fdupes or jdupes to be certain that
output does not change. You get the benefits of an aggressive development
process without putting your data at increased risk.

jdupes includes features that are not found in fdupes. Examples of
such features include btrfs block-level deduplication and control over
which file is kept when a match set is automatically deleted.

The downside is that jdupes development is never guaranteed to be bug-free!
If the program eats your dog or sets fire to your lawn, the authors cannot
be held responsible. If you notice a bug, please report it!

While jdupes maintains some degree of compatibility with fdupes from which
it was originally derived, there is no guarantee that it will continue to
maintain such compatibility in the future.


What jdupes is not: a similar (but not identical) file finding tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that jdupes ONLY works on 100% exact matches. It does not have
any sort of "similarity" matching, nor does it know anything about any
specific file formats such as images or sounds. Something as simple as a
change in embedded metadata such as the ID3 tags in an MP3 file or the EXIF
information in a JPEG image will not change the sound or image presented to
the user when opened, but technically it makes the file no longer identical
to the original.


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: jdupes [options] DIRECTORY...

 -1 --sameline          list each set of matches on a single line
 -A --nohidden          exclude hidden files from consideration
 -d --delete            prompt user for files to preserve and delete all
                        others; important: under particular circumstances,
                        data may be lost when using this option together
                        with -s or --symlinks, or when specifying a
                        particular directory more than once; refer to the
                        documentation for additional information
 -f --omitfirst         omit the first file in each set of matches
 -H --hardlinks         treat hard-linked files as duplicate files. Normally
                        hard links are treated as non-duplicates for safety
 -h --help              display this help message

 -L --linkhard          hard link duplicate files to the first file in
                        each set of duplicates without prompting the user
 -m --summarize         summarize dupe information
 -N --noprompt          together with --delete, preserve the first file in
                        each set of duplicates and delete the rest without
                        prompting the user
 -n --noempty           exclude zero-length files from consideration
 -O --paramorder        Parameter order is more important than selected -O sort
 -o --order=BY          select sort order for output, linking and deleting; by
                        mtime (BY=time) or filename (BY=name, the default)
 -p --permissions       don't consider files with different owner/group or
                        permission bits as duplicates
 -r --recurse           for every directory given follow subdirectories
                        encountered within
 -R --recurse:          for each directory given after this option follow
                        subdirectories encountered within (note the ':' at
                        the end of the option, manpage for more details)
 -S --size              show size of duplicate files
 -s --symlinks          follow symlinks
 -q --quiet             hide progress indicator
 -v --version           display jdupes version and license information
 -x --xsize=SIZE        exclude files of size < SIZE bytes from consideration
    --xsize=+SIZE       '+' specified before SIZE, exclude size > SIZE
                        K/M/G size suffixes can be used (case-insensitive)

Unless -1 or --sameline is specified, duplicate files are listed
together in groups, each file displayed on a separate line. The
groups are then separated from each other by blank lines.

When -1 or --sameline is specified, spaces and backslash characters (\)
appearing in a filename are preceded by a backslash character. For
instance, "with spaces" becomes "with\ spaces".

When using -d or --delete, care should be taken to insure against
accidental data loss. While no information will be immediately
lost, using this option together with -s or --symlink can lead
to confusing information being presented to the user when prompted
for files to preserve. Specifically, a user could accidentally
preserve a symlink while deleting the file it points to. A similar
problem arises when specifying a particular directory more than
once. All files within that directory will be listed as their own
duplicates, leading to data loss should a user preserve a file
without its "duplicate" (the file itself!).


Hard linking status symbols and behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A set of arrows are used in hard linking to show what action was taken on
each link candidate. These arrows are as follows:

----> File was hard linked to the first file in the duplicate chain

-==-> Already a hard link to the first file in the chain

-//-> Hard linking failed due to an error during the linking process

If your data set has hard linked files and you do not use -L to always
consider them as duplicates, you may still see hard linked files appear
together in match sets. This is caused by a separate file that matches
the hard linked files and is the correct behavior.

Microsoft Windows platform-specific notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Windows port does not support Unicode, only ANSI file names. This is
because Unicode support on Windows is difficult to add to existing code
without making it very messy or breaking things. Support is eventually
planned for Unicode on Windows.

Windows has a hard limit of 1024 hard links per file. There is no way to
change this. The documentation for CreateHardLink() states: "The maximum
number of hard links that can be created with this function is 1023 per
file. If more than 1023 links are created for a file, an error results."
(The number is actually 1024, but they're ignoring the first file.)
