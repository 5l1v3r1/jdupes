Installing fdupes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To install the program, issue the following commands:

make
su root
make install

This will install the program in /usr/local/bin. You may change this
to a different location by editing the Makefile. Please refer to
the Makefile for an explanation of compile-time options. If you're
having trouble compiling, please take a look at the Makefile.

Various build options are available and can be turned on at compile
time by setting CFLAGS_EXTRA or by passing it to 'make':

make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DYOUR_OPTION
make CFLAGS_EXTRA='-DYOUR_OPTION_ONE -DYOUR_OPTION_TWO'

This is a list of options that can be "turned on" this way:

ENABLE_BTRFS           Enable '-B/--dedupe' for btrfs deduplication
HAVE_BTRFS_IOCTL_H     Same as ENABLE_BTRFS
DEBUG              *   Turn on algorithm statistic reporting with '-D'
NO_FLOAT               Do not use floating point code
OMIT_GETOPT_LONG       Do not use getopt_long() C library call
ON_WINDOWS             Modify code to compile with MinGW on Windows
USE_TREE_REBALANCE *   Use experimental tree rebalancing code
CONSIDER_IMBALANCE *   Change tree rebalance to analyze weights first

* These options may slow down the program somewhat and are off by
  default. Do not enable them unless you are experimenting.

OLD UPGRADE NOTE: When upgrading from a version prior to 1.2, it should
be noted that the default installation directory for the fdupes man
page has changed from "/usr/man" to "/usr/local/man". If installing
to the default location you should delete the old man page before
proceeding. This file would be named "/usr/man/man1/fdupes.1".

This program was originally called "fdupes" but has been renamed to
"fdupes-jody" to keep it distinctly separate from Adrian Lopez's program.
Be aware of the name change and any problems it may cause on your system
before using fdupes-jody.

A test directory is included so that you may familiarise yourself
with the way fdupes operates. You may test the program before
installing it by issuing a command such as "./fdupes testdir"
or "./fdupes -r testdir", just to name a couple of examples. Refer
to the documentation for information on valid options.

A comparison shell script is also included. It will run your natively
installed 'fdupes' or 'fdupes-jody' with the directories and extra
options you specify and compare the run times and output a 'diff' of
the two program outputs. Unless the core algorithm or sort behavior is
changed, both programs should produce identical outputs and the 'diff'
output shouldn't appear at all. To use it, type:

./compare_fdupes.sh [options]
